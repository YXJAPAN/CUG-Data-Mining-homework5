Note: This is my fifth homework assignment for the Data Mining course, focusing on Recommender Systems. I initially completed the work in PyCharm but migrated it to a Jupyter Notebook (homework5.ipynb) for ease of reading and presentation. The problem solutions and detailed analysis are provided in a separate PDF document, (Homework 5.0 finished.pdf).
In the Python code, the Movielens 100k dataset is loaded using a local file path (ml-100k/u.data). While other data-loading approaches might have been explored during development, to ensure clarity and avoid redundancy in the submitted materials, only the version using the locally present dataset is included in this repository.
